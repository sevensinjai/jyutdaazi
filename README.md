# JyutPing Daa Zi!
This is a game to let you practice with your jyut ping, my mother tongue.

# Motivations
My mother tongue is Cantonese, this project is my attempt to let Hong Kong people to get to know more about their monther tongue. When I was small, we didn't properly learn the phonetic system of our language, so every time we only know how to read a Chinese character but do not know the phoneme behind it.

So I think i would be fun to make a small game to help me practice it. I have found some lyrics from Canto pop songs and converted them into jyutping, ya, im using jyutping, if you are using another system, just let me know and i will add it into the list.

# Remarks
- This repo is cloned from my one of my template, so there is some irrelevant code, but i choose to ignore it (at the moment).
